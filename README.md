## TWO clauses

Join two clauses to make a **conditional sentence**. Conditional sentences tell us that something **will** or **might happen** (some kind of result or consequence) ***IF A CERTAIN CONDITION IS MET.***

> **If-clause**(*hypothesis*)**,** **main clause** (*the result*)
> if-clause sometimes is referred as [[subordinate clause or dependent clause]]
> When a **subordinate clause begins** a sentence, it ***has a comma after it***. When the **main clause begins** the sentence, **there is no comma** to separate it from the dependent clause.

We can flip 2 sentences w/o a change in its meaning, THOUGH, we **NO longer need** coma(**,**).

 >**main clause** (*the result*) **If-clause**(*hypothesis*)

## T0 Zero Conditional or Real - FACTS/TRUE IN GENERAL

> REAL CONDITION + INEVITABLE RESULT
> The result is always **KNOWN**
> **When?** - to talk about things which are **always** or **generally true**, or for **scientific fact, laws and rules**
> **Why is it a conditional?** - it describes what would be true *each time something happens*.

Structure: 
- **If/When** Present Simple, Present Simple

#### Examples

- **If/When** water **freezes**, it **turns** into ice (*Always true: it happens every time you do it*)
- If you **are** hungry, it **means** you need some food/energy (*Always true: you can't avoid it*)
- If you **throw** a ball in the air, it **comes** back down (*Always true: a ball always comes back down every time you throw it in the air*)
- When you **drop** an object, it **falls** (*Always true*)
- If you **heat** ice, it **melts** (*Always true*)
- If you **heat** ice, it **can turn** into water (*"**can**" is used to express a general truth or fact*)
- When sun **sets**, it **gets** dark
- If you **heat** water to 100°C, it **boils**
- If water **reaches** 100 degrees C, it **boils**
- If you **cut** yourself, you **bleed**
- If you **touch** fire, you **get** burned
- If you put the opposite poles of two magnets together, they attract (***scientifically proven***)
- Situations where the result is certain **IF THE “IF CLAUSE”  IS MET**
	- if I **am invited** or I **have** a desire, I go for a walk
	- When I **do** yoga, I **have** more energy to expend
 
### More examples

- If you **click** a button, it **starts** the process
- If you **don't charge** your phone, it **dies**
- If you **turn up** the volume, the music **gets** louder
- If you **don't listen**, you **miss** important information
- if your door **is opened**, anybody **can enter**
- If you **don't water** a plant, it **withers**
- I **never** **take** the bus if the trains **are running** on time
- If he **doesn’t wear** his glasses, he **can’t** see / **Unless** he **wears** his glasses, he **can’t** see
- ***If/When*** I’**m** happy, I smile

### How can we replace IF?

**Whenever**, **every time** or **when** can be used instead of "**IF**"

- **When** you heat water to 100ºC, it boils
- **Every time** you heat water to 100ºC, it boils.
- **Whenever** you heat water to 100ºC, it boils.

> Zero conditional typically describes situations that are always true under certain conditions, and it can be guaranteed but is a possible consequence of the given condition.

## T1 First Conditional - LIKELY TO HAPPEN IN THE PRESENT


> used to refer to the **present or future** where the **situation is real**
> If + any **Present Form** (*present s., present cont. or present prefect*), **Feature/imperative/can/may/might/must/should + bare infinitive/present simple**

**If** or **unless**(= **if not** - normally used with **T1** conditional). following expressions can be used instead of '**if**': **providing, provided (that), as long as, in case, on condition (that), but for (= without), otherwise, or else, what if, supposing, even if, only if**. **Only if** (*with noun and verb inversion*)

- If I **finish** work early, we'**ll go** to the cinema
- If you are not going to hurry, we **will** miss the train
- If you **have finished** you coffee, we **can pay** the bill
- if you'**re** seriously ill, **see** a doctor
	- The **zero** conditional, OTOH, is used for universal truths or habits, where the outcome is always the case **whenever the condition is met**.
- If you **stay** for any longer, you **will be** late
	- Unless you **leave** now, you **will be** late (the same above, but with UNLESS)
- If you **pay**, you **will get** a receipt
- If he **doesn't arrive** soon, we **won't have** time to catch the 9:30 train

### Using modal verbs

Additionally, we can use modal auxiliary verbs other than will (such as must, can, could, may, might, or should) to create different shades of certainty in the future simple tense.

- I **must go** if he **calls** me (*Must expresses a **personal obligation** for the speaker*)
- I **can go** if he **calls** me (*Can expresses **either permission** from a third party or the fact that **speaker is free from other commitments***)
- I **might go** if he **calls** me (*Might expresses a 50% possibility*)
- I **may go** if he **calls** me (*May is similar to **might**, but it is **more formal** and the **possibility is slightly less***)
- I **should go** if he **calls** me (The speaker feels a **mild obligation**)
- *You* **should go** if he **calls** you (The **speaker** is recommending that **you go** or is giving you a **personal opinion**)
- I **can’t go** if he **calls** me (The speaker is **not able** or **does not have permission**)
- I **shouldn’t go** if he calls **me** (The speaker feels a **mild obligation not to**)

### Interrogative sentences (questions)

(unlike "**Only if**" where we inverted (*noun and verb*))
To form a question in the first conditional, we invert the **subject** with the **modal auxiliary verb** 

- If I he **calls** me, **should** I **go**?
- **Could** I **leave** early if Jake **covers** my shift?
- If I **finish** my homework on time, **may** I **go** to the party?
- If I **come** with you, **will** you **buy** me lunch?
### How can we replace IF?

If you **don't** reserve a ticket, you **won't** get a seat. (NOT: ~~Unless you don't reserve~~)

- **Unless**(***If not***) you **reserve** a ticket, you **won't** get a seat
- **Only if** you reserve a ticket **will you get** a seat (When we begin the sentence with "**only if**" , *we **INVERT** the **subject** and the **verb** of the result clause*)
- see the continuation in the table.

| Main Clause                           | Replacement to IF                                           | If clause              |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Reserve a ticket,                     | **otherwise/or else**                                       | you **won't** get seat |
| you **will** get a seat,              | ***providing<br>provided (that)<br>as long as<br>only if*** | you reserve a ticket   |
| **Will** you go for a picnic with him | **even if**                                                 | it rains**?**          |
`What if` it ***rains***, **will** you still ***go*** for a picnic with him?
`Supposing` it **rains**, **will** you still ***go*** for a picnic with him?


- **as soon as**
	- **As soon as** you finish your homework, you **will be** free to play Diablo 2
	- I'**ll** call you **as soon as** I **finish** my work
	- When **will** you **leave** for the airport, **as soon as** you **wake up** or after breakfast?
- **before**
	- Practice with me, and you **will understand** it better **before** the test **comes**
	- Please **finish** you HW **before** you **go out** to play
- **until**
	- I **won't** sleep **until** you **come** home
	- We **will wait** here **until** the rain stops
	- I **won't leave** **until** my phone **reaches** 100%
- **when**
	- You **will be** surprised **when** you **see** results
	- You **can go** home, when you feel tired
	  (*specifically a form of the first conditional used for real, possible situations in the present or future - emphasizes a real possibility based on a specific condition*)
	- I'**ll clean** the kitchen when I **finish** cooking(*gerund*)


We can also use modals like _“**can**,” “**may** / **might**,” “**must**,”_ and _“**should**,”_  as well as imperatives (verbs giving instructions) in the result part of the sentence instead of _“**will**”._ Modal verbs change the certainty of the result.

## T2 Second conditional

> if-clause, would + the bare infinitive

(second conditional) is used when we talk about something we would like to do in the present or future tense, but doing it at the moment is not possible. More often than not, the situation you are talking about is unrealistic.

Unlike the first conditional, we use the second conditional to talk about things that cannot or are unlikely to happen. 
In addition to would:
- **would** (which we use to describe something we **would** *definitely do*), 
- we can also use **could** for what we **would** be able to do, 
- as well as **might** for *what it is possible (but unlikely) we would do*.

After '**if**' we normally use **were** instead of **was** in all persons in **T2** conditionals in formal situations. **Was** is manly used in spoken English

For example: 
- If I **went** to London, I **would** visit Trafalgar Square
- If I **won** the lottery, I **could** buy a new house (*possible to buy a new house*)
- If I won the lottery, I would buy a new house (*expresses a stronger intention or plan to buy a new house*)
- If you **had** a phone, you **could** call me every day
- If I **was/were**** older, I **might** stay up all night long

We can also put the second conditional in the negative to describe something that would not be the case if something else were also not the case. To form the negative, we use the negative of the past simple in the if clause, and make would negative in the clause describing the result of the condition.

- If our father **didn’t** work so hard, we **wouldn’t** be able to afford this house
- If I **didn’t** live in London, I **could** never speak English so well
- If we **didn't** save our money, we **wouldn't** travel during the summer
- If she **weren't** so dedicated, she **might not** have achieved such success in her career
- If they **didn't** practice daily, they **wouldn't** perform so well in the competitions

If I **were** you, I **would** study for exams.
If we **had** a car, we **would** go for a drive in the country.

  (unreal or less likely scenario. It implies that winning the lottery is not expected, but hypothetically, if it happened, buying a house would be the result)
